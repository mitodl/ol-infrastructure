# Repository Conventions

## Introduction

This document outlines the conventions and structure of this repository. It is intended to be used as a guide for developers and as a shared context for AI-powered development tools to ensure consistency and maintainability of the codebase.

The repository manages cloud infrastructure using a combination of Concourse for CI/CD, Pulumi for infrastructure as code (IaC), and Packer for building machine images (AMIs).

## Core Technologies

*   **CI/CD**: [Concourse CI](https://concourse-ci.org/)
*   **Infrastructure as Code**: [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) (using Python)
*   **Image Building**: [HashiCorp Packer](https://www.packer.io/) (using HCL and PyInfra for provisioning)
*   **Primary Language**: Python 3
*   **Configuration & Data Validation**: [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/)

## Repository Structure

The `src/` directory contains all the source code, organized by function:

*   `src/bilder/`: Contains Packer configurations for building AMIs.
    *   `components/`: Reusable Packer provisioners and configurations (e.g., installing Vault, Consul, Vector).
    *   `images/`: Definitions for specific AMIs, which compose components from `src/bilder/components/`.
*   `src/ol_concourse/`: Contains Concourse pipeline definitions, written in Python.
    *   `lib/`: A custom library for generating Concourse pipeline YAML from Python objects.
    *   `pipelines/`: The definitions for each CI/CD pipeline.
*   `src/ol_infrastructure/`: Contains Pulumi code for defining and managing cloud infrastructure.
    *   `applications/`: Pulumi stacks for specific applications (e.g., `xqwatcher`).
    *   `components/`: Reusable Pulumi components (e.g., an auto-scaling group).
    *   `infrastructure/`: Foundational infrastructure stacks (e.g., AWS networking, IAM, EKS).
    *   `lib/`: Helper functions and classes for working with Pulumi and AWS.
*   `src/bridge/`: Utility code that bridges other components, often for handling secrets or settings.

## Pulumi Conventions (`src/ol_infrastructure/`)

*   **Language**: All Pulumi code is written in Python.
*   **Structure**: Infrastructure is organized into projects and stacks. Each directory within `src/ol_infrastructure/infrastructure/` and `src/ol_infrastructure/applications/` typically represents a Pulumi project.
*   **Configuration**: Pydantic models, often inheriting from `ol_infrastructure.lib.ol_types.AWSBase`, are used to define the configuration for infrastructure components. This provides type safety and validation.
*   **Stack Information**: The `ol_infrastructure.lib.pulumi_helper.StackInfo` dataclass provides context about the current Pulumi stack (e.g., name, environment). It is instantiated via `parse_stack()`.
*   **Naming**: Pulumi resources should be given a descriptive name that includes the component and purpose. Tags are automatically applied, including `business_unit` and `environment`.
*   **IAM Policies**: IAM policies are linted using Parliament via `ol_infrastructure.lib.aws.iam_helper.lint_iam_policy`.

## Packer Conventions (`src/bilder/`)

*   **Templates**: Packer templates are defined using HCL (`.pkr.hcl` files). Variables are used extensively to parameterize builds.
*   **Provisioning**: Provisioning is primarily done using Python scripts, which often leverage `pyinfra` for executing commands and managing state on the instance being built. These scripts are found in `steps.py` files within component directories.
*   **Components**: Builds are composed of reusable components found in `src/bilder/components/`. An image definition in `src/bilder/images/` will typically include one or more of these components.
*   **Naming**: AMI names are constructed from variables defined in the HCL files, typically including `app_name`, `build_environment`, and a timestamp.

## Concourse Conventions (`src/ol_concourse/`)

*   **Pipeline Generation**: Concourse pipeline YAML files are not written by hand. Instead, they are generated from Python code located in `src/ol_concourse/pipelines/`.
*   **Modeling**: The `src/ol_concourse/lib/models/` directory contains Pydantic models that represent Concourse concepts (e.g., `Pipeline`, `Job`, `GetStep`, `TaskStep`). Pipelines are constructed by instantiating and composing these models.
*   **Fragments**: The `PipelineFragment` model is used to create reusable pieces of pipelines that can be combined. This is useful for standardizing resource types or groups of jobs.
*   **Resources**: Helper functions like `ol_concourse.lib.resources.git_repo` and `ol_concourse.lib.resources.registry_image` should be used to define resources in a consistent manner.
*   **Jobs**: Helper functions like `ol_concourse.lib.jobs.infrastructure.packer_jobs` and `ol_concourse.lib.jobs.infrastructure.pulumi_jobs_chain` are used to generate standard job patterns for building images and deploying infrastructure.

## General Python Conventions

*   **Type Hinting**: All code should be fully type-hinted.
*   **Pydantic**: Pydantic is the standard for data modeling, configuration management, and data validation. Use `BaseModel` for data structures and `BaseSettings` for configuration loaded from the environment.
*   **Dependencies**: Project dependencies are managed with `uv`.
*   **Formatting**: Code should be formatted using `ruff format`.
*   **Linting**: Code should pass `ruff` checks.
