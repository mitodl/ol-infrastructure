Any configuration update you make in this area should be duplicated in `src/ol_infrastructure/applications/edxapp`.

If it is simply a static value, you can add it to `files/edxapp/mitxonline/<appropirate yaml file>`.

If it is a configuration that is dynamic or a secret, talk to Mike and he will help you figure out the best way to do it.
