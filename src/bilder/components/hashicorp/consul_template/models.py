    namespace: Optional[str]

    # This is the token to use when communicating with the Vault server.
    # Like other tools that integrate with Vault, Consul Template makes the
    # assumption that you provide it with a Vault token; it does not have the
    # incorporated logic to generate tokens via Vault's auth methods.
    #
    # This value can also be specified via the environment variable VAULT_TOKEN.
    # It is highly recommended that you do not put your token in plain-text in a
    # configuration file.
    #
    # When using a token from Vault Agent, the vault_agent_token_file setting
    # should be used instead, as that will take precedence over this field.
    token: Optional[str]

    # This tells Consul Template to load the Vault token from the contents of a file.
    # If this field is specified:
    # - by default Consul Template will not try to renew the Vault token, if you want it
    # to renew you will need to specify renew_token = true as below.
    # - Consul Template will periodically stat the file and update the token if it has
    # changed.
    # vault_agent_token_file = "/tmp/vault/agent/token"

    # This tells Consul Template that the provided token is actually a wrapped
    # token that should be unwrapped using Vault's cubbyhole response wrapping
    # before being used. Please see Vault's cubbyhole response wrapping
    # documentation for more information.
    unwrap_token: Optional[bool]

    # The default lease duration Consul Template will use on a Vault secret that
    # does not have a lease duration. This is used to calculate the sleep duration
    # for rechecking a Vault secret value. This field is optional and will default to
    # 5 minutes.
    default_lease_duration: Optional[str]

    # This option tells Consul Template to automatically renew the Vault token
    # given. If you are unfamiliar with Vault's architecture, Vault requires
    # tokens be renewed at some regular interval or they will be revoked. Consul
    # Template will automatically renew the token at half the lease duration of
    # the token. The default value is true, but this option can be disabled if
    # you want to renew the Vault token using an out-of-band process.
    #
    # Note that secrets specified in a template (using {{secret}} for example)
    # are always renewed, even if this option is set to false. This option only
    # applies to the top-level Vault token itself.

    # agent. It is not recommended that you communicate directly with a Consul
    # server, and instead communicate with the local Consul agent. There are many
    # reasons for this, most importantly the Consul agent is able to multiplex
    # connections to the Consul server and reduce the number of open HTTP
    # connections. Additionally, it provides a "well-known" IP address for which
    # clients can connect.
    address: str = "127.0.0.1:8500"

    # This controls the retry behavior when an error is returned from Consul.
    # Consul Template is highly fault tolerant, meaning it does not exit in the

    # zero will implement an unlimited number of retries.

    # This is the base amount of time to sleep between retry attempts. Each
    # retry sleeps for an exponent of 2 longer than this base. For 5 retries,

    # backoff = "250ms"

    # This is the maximum amount of time to sleep between retry attempts.
    # When max_backoff is set to zero, there is no upper limit to the
    # exponential sleep between retry attempts.
    # If max_backoff is set to 10s and backoff is set to 1s, sleep times

    # This is the path to the certificate to use to authenticate. If just a
    # certificate is provided, it is assumed to contain both the certificate and
