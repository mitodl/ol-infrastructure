# Agent Instructions for ol-infrastructure Repository

## Repository Overview

This is a **large-scale infrastructure-as-code monorepo** (467 Python files, ~91K lines of code) for managing MIT Open Learning's cloud infrastructure. The repository combines **Pulumi** for infrastructure provisioning, **Packer/PyInfra** for building AMIs, and **Concourse** for CI/CD pipelines—all managed through Python.

**Trust these instructions.** They are comprehensive and validated. Only search for additional information if these instructions are incomplete or incorrect.

## Essential Build & Validation Commands

### Environment Setup (One-Time)
```bash
# Install dependencies (ALWAYS run first after cloning)
uv sync

# Login to Pulumi state backend (required for Pulumi operations)
pulumi login s3://mitol-pulumi-state
```

### Linting & Formatting (Fast: <1 second)
```bash
# Format code (auto-fixes formatting issues)
uv run ruff format src/

# Check code style and quality (completes in <0.1s)
uv run ruff check src/

# Check code with auto-fixes
uv run ruff check --fix src/

# Format Packer HCL files
packer fmt -recursive src/bilder/
```

### Type Checking (Slow: ~75 seconds)
```bash
# Run mypy type checking (this is SLOW, budget 75+ seconds)
uv run mypy src/
```

**Note:** Expect ~1316 type errors and ~809 ruff errors in the codebase. Your changes should not introduce NEW errors.

### Pre-commit Hooks
```bash
# Run all pre-commit hooks (includes ruff, mypy, shellcheck, yamllint, etc.)
# Note: hadolint may fail on existing Docker issues—ignore if unrelated to your changes
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Testing
```bash
# Run tests (minimal test coverage exists)
uv run pytest tests/
```

## Critical Build Constraints

1. **Dependencies:** Use `uv` (v0.9.3+), NOT Poetry. README mentions Poetry but repository uses `uv`.
2. **Python Version:** Python 3.12.x required (specified in `pyproject.toml`)
3. **Linting:** Code MUST pass `ruff format` and minimize new `ruff check` errors
4. **Type Checking:** Run `mypy` but expect many existing errors (1316+)—only fix new ones
5. **Pre-commit:** Tests may fail on unrelated Docker linting—ignore if not your changes

### Configuration Files (Root)

- `pyproject.toml` — Python dependencies (uv format), ruff/mypy config
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` — Pre-commit hook definitions
- `.sops.yaml` — SOPS encryption rules (KMS key mappings)
- `uv.lock` — Locked dependency versions

## Pulumi Project Structure

Each directory with a `Pulumi.yaml` is a **Pulumi project** (68 total). Example: `src/ol_infrastructure/infrastructure/aws/network/`

```
network/
├── Pulumi.yaml                                      # Project definition
├── __main__.py                                      # Entrypoint (deployment code)
├── Pulumi.infrastructure.aws.network.QA.yaml        # QA environment stack config
├── Pulumi.infrastructure.aws.network.Production.yaml # Production stack config
└── ...additional modules
```

**Stack naming convention:** `<namespace>.<environment>` where environment is `QA`, `Production`, `CI`, or `Dev`.

### Running Pulumi Commands

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd src/ol_infrastructure/infrastructure/aws/network/

# List available stacks
pulumi stack ls

# Select a stack
pulumi stack select infrastructure.aws.network.QA

# Preview changes (like terraform plan)
pulumi preview

# Deploy changes (CAREFUL: affects real infrastructure)
pulumi up

# Or run from repo root
pulumi -C src/ol_infrastructure/infrastructure/aws/network/ preview
```

**Key Pulumi Helpers:**
- `ol_infrastructure.lib.pulumi_helper.parse_stack()` — Returns `StackInfo` dataclass with stack name/environment
- `ol_infrastructure.lib.ol_types` — Pydantic models for configurations (inherit from `AWSBase`)

## Packer AMI Building

Packer images in `src/bilder/images/` use HCL definitions and PyInfra for provisioning.

**Build workflow (not typically run locally):**
1. Packer reads `.pkr.hcl` files (variables, builder config)
2. Launches EC2 instance from base AMI
3. Runs `deploy.py` using PyInfra to configure instance
4. Creates AMI snapshot

**Common operations:**
```bash
# Format Packer files
packer fmt src/bilder/images/

# Validate a Packer template (requires AWS credentials)
cd src/bilder/images/consul/
packer validate .
```

**PyInfra provisioning (`deploy.py`):** Pure Python scripts that define system state (install packages, configure services, etc.). See `src/bilder/images/consul/deploy.py` for example.

## Secrets Management (SOPS + Vault)

**Workflow:**
1. Secrets stored in git as SOPS-encrypted YAML files (`src/bridge/secrets/<context>/`)
2. SOPS config (`.sops.yaml`) defines KMS keys by environment (QA/Production/CI)
3. During `pulumi up`, `bridge.secrets.sops.set_env_secrets()` decrypts secrets in-memory
4. Pulumi writes secrets to HashiCorp Vault
5. Applications read secrets from Vault at runtime

**Required tools:** `sops` CLI (v3.11.0+), AWS credentials for KMS access

## Common Issues & Workarounds

### Issue: README mentions Poetry but `poetry.lock` doesn't exist
**Solution:** Repository has migrated to `uv`. Always use `uv sync` and `uv run <command>`.

### Issue: pre-commit hook `hadolint-docker` fails with existing Docker warnings
**Solution:** Ignore hadolint failures if your changes don't affect Dockerfiles. These are pre-existing issues.

### Issue: `mypy` reports 1316 errors
**Solution:** Expected. Only fix new errors introduced by your changes. Many legacy type issues exist.

### Issue: `ruff check` reports 809 errors
**Solution:** Expected. Focus on not introducing NEW errors. Consider using `--fix` for auto-fixable issues.

### Issue: Pulumi operation requires AWS credentials
**Solution:** Ensure AWS CLI is configured (`aws configure`) or environment variables are set.

### Issue: `uv` warns about `~=3.12` in `requires-python`
**Solution:** This is a warning, not an error. Ignore it—fixing requires changing project config.

### Issue: Timeout running commands
**Solution:**
- `mypy src/` takes 75+ seconds—increase timeout to 120s
- `uv run pytest` may need 60s timeout depending on test scope

## Code Style & Conventions

### Python
- **Type hints required:** All functions/methods must have type annotations
- **Pydantic for models:** Use `BaseModel` for data, `BaseSettings` for config
- **Imports:** Follow `ruff` isort rules (run `ruff format` to auto-fix)
- **Docstrings:** PEP 257 style (enforced by ruff)

### Pulumi
- **Projects:** Each `Pulumi.yaml` directory is a project
- **Stacks:** Named as `<namespace>.<environment>` (e.g., `infrastructure.aws.network.QA`)
- **Tags:** Use `ol_infrastructure.lib.ol_types.BusinessUnit` enum for OU tags
- **IAM policies:** Lint with `ol_infrastructure.lib.aws.iam_helper.lint_iam_policy()`

### Packer
- **HCL formatting:** Always run `packer fmt -recursive src/bilder/` before committing
- **Components:** Reuse components from `src/bilder/components/` instead of duplicating logic

## Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

### What are ADRs?

**Architecture Decision Records** (ADRs) document important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They capture the "why" behind decisions, not just the "what."

**Key characteristics:**
- Lightweight markdown documents in `docs/adr/`
- Numbered sequentially (`NNNN-title-with-dashes.md`)
- Immutable once accepted (supersede with new ADRs, don't edit)
- Include: Status, Context, Decision, Consequences

### When to Create an ADR (for AI Agents)

**ALWAYS create an ADR when you:**

1. **Make infrastructure architecture changes:**
   - ✅ Change ingress controllers, service mesh, or routing patterns
   - ✅ Introduce new core technologies (databases, caching, messaging)
   - ✅ Modify deployment strategies or blue-green patterns
   - ✅ Change monitoring, logging, or observability approaches
   - ✅ Alter authentication or security mechanisms

2. **Make decisions affecting multiple systems:**
   - ✅ Changes impacting 5+ applications or stacks
   - ✅ Cross-team coordination required
   - ✅ Breaking changes to existing patterns

3. **Evaluate multiple options:**
   - ✅ You compared 2+ approaches during the session
   - ✅ Trade-offs were analyzed
   - ✅ The decision isn't obvious or standard practice

4. **Create significant technical debt or constraints:**
   - ✅ Decision limits future options
   - ✅ Temporary workarounds that will persist
   - ✅ Compromises made due to time/resource constraints

5. **Spend significant effort (>8 hours):**
   - ✅ Large refactoring or migration projects
   - ✅ Multi-phase implementations
   - ✅ Changes that are difficult or expensive to reverse

### When NOT to Create an ADR

**Skip ADRs for:**
- ❌ Trivial changes following established patterns
- ❌ Bug fixes that don't change architecture
- ❌ Code refactoring without architectural impact
- ❌ Configuration value changes (non-architectural)
- ❌ Single-file or single-function changes
- ❌ Obvious choices with no alternatives
- ❌ Temporary experiments or POCs that won't persist

**Rule of thumb:** If a developer 6 months from now would ask "Why did we do it this way?", create an ADR.

### ADR Creation Process for Agents

When you determine an ADR is needed:

1. **During your coding session:**
   ```bash
   # Copy the template
   cp docs/adr/template.md docs/adr/NNNN-your-title.md
   # NNNN = next sequential number (check existing ADRs)
   ```

2. **Fill in the ADR sections:**
   - **Status:** Always start with "Proposed"
   - **Context:** Explain the problem, drivers, constraints, options considered
   - **Decision:** State the chosen option and rationale
   - **Consequences:** List positive, negative, and neutral outcomes

3. **Reference your analysis:**
   - Link to comparison tables or analysis docs you created
   - Include effort estimates and risk assessments
   - Document alternatives you explored

4. **Mark for human review:**
   - Leave status as "Proposed"
   - Add note in "Review History" section: "Created by AI agent, pending human approval"
   - Human will update to "Accepted" or "Rejected"

### ADR Template Quick Reference

```markdown
# NNNN. {Title}

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Deciders:** {AI Agent + Human Reviewer}
**Technical Story:** {Link to PR/Issue}

## Context
{Problem statement, drivers, constraints, options considered}

## Decision
{Chosen option and rationale}

## Consequences
{Positive, negative, and neutral outcomes}
```

**Full template:** `docs/adr/template.md`
**ADR Guide:** `docs/adr/README.md`

### Examples from This Repository

- **ADR-0001:** Use ADR for Architecture Decisions (meta-ADR)
- **ADR-0002:** Migrate to Gateway API HTTPRoute (example from agentic session)

### ADR Best Practices for Agents

**DO:**
- ✅ Create ADR during the session, not after
- ✅ Document all options you evaluated (not just the chosen one)
- ✅ Be honest about negative consequences and trade-offs
- ✅ Include effort estimates and risk levels
- ✅ Link to related planning docs or analysis
- ✅ Write clearly for future developers (assume they lack your context)

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Mark ADR as "Accepted" (only humans can accept)
- ❌ Edit existing ADRs (create new ADR to supersede)
- ❌ Write ADRs for trivial or standard changes
- ❌ Skip ADRs for architectural decisions (err on side of documenting)
- ❌ Forget to update `docs/adr/README.md` index

### Integration with Workflow

**When making Pulumi changes:**
1. Determine if ADR needed (see criteria above)
2. If yes, create ADR alongside code changes
3. Include ADR in same PR as code changes
4. Human reviews both code and ADR
5. ADR status updated during PR merge

**When exploring options:**
- If you create comparison tables or analysis docs during a session
- AND you make a recommendation
- THEN create an ADR documenting the decision

**When migrating or refactoring:**
- Multi-phase projects (like Gateway API migration) → Create ADR
- Include link to detailed migration plan
- ADR captures the "why" and high-level approach
- Plan captures the "how" and detailed steps

### ADR Numbering

Check existing ADRs to determine next number:
```bash
ls docs/adr/ | grep -E "^[0-9]{4}" | sort -n | tail -1
# Increment the number for your ADR
```

Current sequence: 0002 (use 0003 for next ADR)

### Questions?

- **"Is this architectural?"** If it affects how systems connect, deploy, or operate → Yes
- **"Do I need approval?"** ADRs need human review; mark as "Proposed" and let humans accept
- **"Can I skip this?"** When in doubt, create ADR. 15 minutes now saves hours of confusion later
- **"Where do I learn more?"** Read `docs/adr/README.md` and existing ADRs as examples
